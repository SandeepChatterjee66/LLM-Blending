These ancient Egyptian texts were inscribed on the walls of pharaohs\' tombs and contained spells and prayers believed to help guide the deceased through the afterlife.\n\n**The Sumerian King List**\n\nThe **Sumerian King List**, also from Mesopotamia, is another early written work that dates back to around 2100 BCE. This tablet lists the kings of Sumer, along with their lengths of reign and notable achievements.\n\n**Homer\'s Epics**\n\nIn ancient Greece, Homer\'s epics, **The Iliad** (circa 8th century BCE) and **The Odyssey** (circa 7th century BCE), are considered some of the earliest surviving works of Western literature. While we don\'t know who exactly wrote them, these epic poems have had a profound influence on Western culture.\n\n**What about the "first" book in terms of printing?**\n\nIn terms of printed books, the first book to be mass-produced with movable type is generally considered to be:\n\n* **The Gutenberg Bible**, created by Johannes Gutenberg around 1455 CE.

['While Margaret Mitchell is indeed the author of the classic novel "Gone With the Wind", she didn\'t actually write it. She was, however, the person who came up with the idea and wrote the book.\n\nMargaret Mitchell was an American journalist and historian from Georgia, and she spent several years researching and writing "Gone With the Wind". The book is a historical novel set during the American Civil War and Reconstruction era, and its story follows Scarlett O\'Hara, a strong-willed southern belle, as she navigates the challenges of war, love, loss, and survival.\n\nMargaret Mitchell wrote the first draft of the manuscript in 1936, but it was heavily edited by her husband, John R. Marsh, and other publishers before its publication on June 30, 1936. The book went on to become a huge bestseller and won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937.\n\nHowever, while Mitchell wrote the original manuscript, the novel\'s actual authorship is often credited to someone else: Arthur Laurents, a Hollywood screenwriter who worked on the film adaptation of "Gone With the Wind" (1939). According to some accounts, Laurents made significant changes to Mitchell\'s original text for the movie version.\n\nSo, while Margaret Mitchell wrote the initial draft of "Gone With the Wind", the final product is often credited as a collaborative effort between her and others.', "This conversation has just started.
