['Dark energy is a mysterious force that plays a role in the accelerating expansion of the universe. It is believed to account for about 68% of the total energy in the observable universe and acts as an anti-gravity force, counteracting the gravitational pull of gravity.

This acceleration can be explained by a combination of factors, including gravity, dark matter, and the expansion of the Milky Way galaxy. We know that dark energy is causing the acceleration by comparing the brightness of Type Ia supernovae at different distances from Earth to those of nearby galaxies.', 'Dark energy is currently the most widely accepted explanation for the accelerating expansion of the universe.

["DNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes new strands of DNA by adding nucleotides one by one, complementary to the template strand. This ensures accuracy in molecular biology because DNA polymerase can distinguish between the two DNA strands due to their directionality and base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C). It also adds nucleotides only to the 3'-OH group of the growing daughter strand based on the directionality and base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C).", "The proofreading process is an essential step in DNA replication.

["Pharmacokinetics is the study of how drugs move through the body. The four main processes are absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME). Absorption refers to the process by which a drug moves from its site of administration (e.g., oral, intravenous) into the bloodstream. Factors that affect absorption include the drug's solubility in body fluids, the rate of absorption, and the size of the gastrointestinal tract. Distribution refers to the movement of a drug from its site of administration (e.g., oral, intrave", 'Different routes of administration affect drug absorption and distribution. For example, oral administration involves swallowing a pill or capsule, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract. Intravenous administration, on the other hand, involves injecting a drug directly into the bloodstream, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and first-pass metabolism. This means that the drug is rapidly absorbed and distributed throughout the body.', 'Factors such as lipid solubility, protein binding, and pH affect drug distribution and elimination.
