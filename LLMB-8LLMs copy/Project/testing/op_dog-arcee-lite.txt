The Back to the Future franchise consists of four movies:
- Back to the Future (1985)
- Back to the Future Part II (1989)
- Back to the Future Part III (1990)
- The Return of the MacDefaults (2007)

In all four films, the main character who invents the time machine is Marty McFly. He creates a DeLorean car which allows him and his friends to travel through time. This type of vehicle is called a DeLorean in reference to the brand's sponsorship by Universal Studios. 

The DeLorean runs on an internal combustion engine powered by gasoline, though it also uses an advanced fuel source known as "D-Link" for transportation between Earth and the future.

In terms of years, Marty McFly travels back to 1955 in Back to the Future Part II and then goes forward in time several decades to the year 2015 in the final film. However, it is not explicitly stated which year he travels to in the first film. More context or dialogue within the movies would be needed to determine this exact detail.
