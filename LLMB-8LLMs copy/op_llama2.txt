['\nThe head coach of Orlando City SC is Oscar Pareja.', '\nThe year of inception for the term "AI" (Artificial Intelligence) is difficult to pinpoint, as the concept of artificial intelligence has been around for centuries. However, the modern field of AI as we know it today began to take shape in the mid-20th century. Here are some significant milestones in the history of AI:\n\n1. 1950s: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined by John McCarthy at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. However, the ideas and concepts that led to the development of AI can be traced back to ancient times, such as the Greek myth of Talos, which describes a machine made of bronze that could move and act on its own.\n2. 1951: The first AI program, called Logical Theorist, is developed by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon at the RAND Corporation. This program was able to simulate human problem-solving abilities by using logical reasoning and search algorithms to solve problems.\n3. 1956: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined by John McCarthy at a conference at Dartmouth College.\n4. 1960s: The field of AI begins to take shape, with the establishment of the first AI research centers and the development of new algorithms and techniques for machine reasoning and problem-solving.\n5. 1968: The first AI language, Lisp, is developed by John McCarthy. Lisp becomes a popular programming language for AI applications due to its ability to manipulate symbols and perform pattern recognition.\n6. 1970s: AI research experiences a boom in funding and interest, with the establishment of large-scale AI projects such as the ARPANET network and the development of expert systems. However, the field also faces criticism for its lack of tangible results and overemphasis on theoretical approaches.\n7. 1980s: The AI community shifts its focus towards more practical applications of AI, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. This leads to the development of new algorithms and techniques that are more effective in solving real-world problems.\n8. 1990s: The rise of the internet and the World Wide Web leads to new opportunities for AI research, including the development of intelligent agents and the use of machine learning techniques for data analysis and prediction.\n9. 2000s: The field of AI experiences a resurgence in interest and investment, driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and machine learning algorithms. This leads to the development of more sophisticated AI systems, such as deep learning networks and natural language processing systems.\n10. Present day: AI continues to be a rapidly evolving field, with new breakthroughs and innovations being made regularly.

"The Edison Electric Recordings" (1877): This is often cited as the earliest surviving album, containing recordings of songs and music made by Thomas Edison and his assistants using their first phonograph machine.
